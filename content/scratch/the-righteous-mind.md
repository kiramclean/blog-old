At first this seemed like a very low few of humanity to me. I feel like I need to have a little funeral for the idea that reason is the ultimate tool we can use to reach valid and true conclusions. That's hard to let of for me. I have always held it to be the highest and most respectable thing.

**Outline**

- About the book
  - lays out moral foundations theory
  - would probably say that trying to sum it up like this defeats the purpose of trying to explain it, especially to a bunch of strangers
  - but anyway, my goal isn't so much to rehash the book, more to reflect on what it changed in my own thinking
- What I thought of it
  - certainly changed some things
  - I go back and forth
    - charitable feelings that those who disagree with me are not in fact moral monsters and must have some basis for their positions that I just can't understand
    - feeling like all hope is lost and half of humanity is bent on self destruction and making life as miserable as possible for women and racial/sexual minorities whilst enriching and perpetuating their own superiority
      - obviously, this is not true of as many people as I suspect
      - I do think it is true for some, though
  - this book gave me language and a framework for understanding what might be driving attitudes and opinions I struggle to understand
    - it didn't get me all the way, though
    - I believe these people believe they are simply upholding morality
    - I believe they are likely aware of some threats to the fabric of society that I am blind to because of my upbringing and privilege
    - but I still don't believe there are multiple possible moral positions on many topics
    - e.g. it honestly appears to me as though there is a single moral answer to the question of whether (insert oppressed minority here) should be treated as the equals of those in power (heterosexual white men, in my world)
    - I understand that concerns about full inclusion of women in public life or full civil equality for sexual or gender minorities may be _founded_ on a deeper, more instinctual reaction to certain moral principles (respect for authority of e.g. the church, adherence to certain "biblical truths", loyalty to a group or society that shuns these people)
    - but these reactions seem to me to be misfiring and in desperate need of correction
    - how do I know this? the harm caused by these views
- What I took from it
  - an interesting framework for understanding my own morality
  - helpful insights into the psychology of fear, disgust, sanctity, loyalty, and authority that inform the moral judgements of other people (who are often unaware and unable to explain why they feel the way they do)
- Would I recommend it
  - highly
  - I hope it will lead to some fruitful conversations
  - I'm grateful to have people in my life who are different from me in my life
  - most of my most meaningful and deep relationships are with these people
    - partly reveals to me that I'm an oddball and don't often meet people like me
    - partly reveals that I'm more attracted to them

I have strong reactions to things and can't explain why. This happens to me fairly frequently. Until recently it never really bothered me. I could express those feelings

- examine my own morality in light of moral foundations theory
- sympathize iwth others whose morality differs from my own
- explain why it's still so hard for me to swallow
  - seems to imply all foundations are equivalent
  - totally foreign to me -- how could an ethic of divinity _possibly_ matter more than ethics that dictate minimizing the suffering of _real_ human beings?
- it's hard to understand and accept that there are people who care less about human suffering than I do

* crave a serious explanation fot why we feel the way we do about groups/religion
* notice that I have very strong, visceral reactions to certain things

- my elephant is wandering, lost in the jungle
  - my rider tried to lead the way for a bit and now I'm completely lost
  - I hope its instincts are sound enough to find the way to water again, and then back to the herd

It quickly became obvious to me that people already knew what they believed and knew how to make it look like the Bible said exactly what they happend to already think. Liberals are honest about it -- they'll admit they selectively apply biblical wisdom, but point out that everybody does. E.g. not even the most conservative churches force women to cover their head or forbid them from speaking entirely, or would support slavery as a God-ordained institution that we ought to get in line with (anymore). Conservatives are more likely to beleive they're just doing "what the bible says", as though it's possible to read anything without our own preconceptions and ideas. They'll claim the meaning of scripture is clear and they're just living it out. It's obvious this isn't true when they're pressed on certain issues, though.

- E.g. helping the poor or defending the rights of the foreigner
- Pharisees were very concerned with other people's morality
- Conservatives believe the government should be morality police, not regulator and overseer of free individuals
- The Jesus story is about a man who repeatedly condemns this kind of thinking. What matters is not superficial adherence to orthodoxy, it's purity of heart and intention that matter. What matters is not following the rules, it's seeing past cultural handcuffs to understand the real intention of the rules and shaping society to conform to them. Jesus could have condemne modern conservative Christians as Pharisees.
  - God commanding us to be stewards of the earth

* The threshold for seeing similarities is lower amond liberals? We care more about people who are like us -- tolerance comes from common/shared beliefs and practices. For some simply being human is enough of a similarity that it triggers this, for some it's simply being _alive_, for some it's much harder to see similarities. They have to be the same race, gender, sexual orientation, etc.

taking religion seriously

- my attraction to the New Atheists was that they ackowledged reality in ways that religious people just didn't
- they believe in reason in the same way religious people believe in absolute truth -- both are fabrications of human minds, ways to try to make sense of the chaos we live in, neither are real.
