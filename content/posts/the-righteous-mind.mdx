## Wanting to Understand Righteous Minds

I feel strongly about quite a few things and am bad at expressing my feelings with words. This is a pretty unfortunate combination. Until recently it didn't really matter much. In university pretty much everybody had strong opinions about lots of things. I fit right in. 

After a few years of living in the real world, though, I've observed that people hold a much wider range of views than I was ever exposed to in humanities courses at school. I've also observed that most people are much more sensitive than liberal arts students and professors. My language and tone often end up offending people now, rather than engaging them in intense debate, like before (which is the intention -- I certainly don't seek to offend on purpose). What I have also observed is that everyone appears to be equally sure that they're right.

Of course "everyone" is an exaggeration. There are a rare few who seem capable of introspecting and considering the possibility that they may, in fact, be wrong. Who understand that others have reasons for thinking the way they do and are not simply ignorant or evil. Who are open to the possibility of changing their minds. These people are rare, though. I only hear them on podcasts and read their books. I want to be like them.

This whole journey has led me to a great interest in psychology. How is it that two people with opposing views can both be so sure that they're right? And why do I feel so confident in my own conclusions most of the time? How can I begin to move past my feelings of disdain and anger toward people who hold views I consider immoral, in the interest of building relationships? Because among these people are some I love dearly.

I asked these questions in public and someone suggested I read Johnathan Haidt's book _The Righteous Mind_ as a starting point. The book was helpful and enlightening. I find thinking in public a useful way to process new concepts, so below is a summary of the first section of the book along with my take-aways from it. I'll spend some more words in subsequent posts working through my conclusions from the rest of the book.

## Reason is second to intuition

In the first section of the book, Haidt presents convincing evidence that we don't have nearly as much control over what we think as we would like to believe. He summarizes study after study which shows that we come to conclusions first, then try to come up with reasons why we believe those conclusions are correct _after_ the fact. Moral reasoning happens after we have already reached our moral conclusions. It is not something we do in search of the truth. It is what we do to try to convince others (and sometimes ourselves) that where we stand makes sense.

This is contrary to the way most people think humans work. The prevailing belief (at least in my circles) is that truth is ascertained through reason. Ask the right questions and think hard enough and you will eventually find the truth. The flip side of that world view is that if you give the right answers and engage someone long enough, their rational mind will eventually see the error of its ways and start believing the truth you've just laid out so clearly for them. 

Haidt's examination of these studies provided me with enough evidence to be convinced that this is not how it works. The reality is that we do not reason in search of the truth. We reason to support our intuitive judgments, which present themselves long before our thinking selves have a chance to do anything like construct a rational argument. Discussions that appear to be sincere attempts to discern the truth are just post-hoc fabrications aimed at justifying our intuitions.

## Disagreement should trigger charity and empathy, not contempt and disgust

This realization affects the way I engage in conversation with others. I'm suddenly much more sympathetic toward those I disagree with. I hope that as I reflect on this book some more it will continue to shape my attitudes. Despite not being in university anymore, I still find myself spending a fair amount of time discussing important issues. I've witnessed what Johnathan Haidt calls "moral dumbfounding", and always took it as a sign that someone was at best intellectually lazy that day, at worst an ignoramus. In reality they are simply scrambling to come with with an explanation for a position they most likely did not come to through reasoned argument.

If you've never witnessed moral dumbfounding, try asking a right-wing American how they can oppose abortion but support the death penalty. Or a conservative Christian why homosexuality excludes a person from church leadership but adultery does not. Or a left-wing American why murderers should be rehabilitated and reintegrated into society but not Kevin Spacey. 

The reason the arguments you'll hear sound incoherent (unless perhaps you happen to already agree with them) is because they _are_. Our views are illogical and internally inconsistent because they are not the well-reasoned, rational positions we claim they are. They are gut reactions informed more than anything by our upbringing, culture, and circumstance. The explanations we give for why we hold them are pieced together after we have already concluded what we believe. Our thinking self is more like a defense lawyer or press secretary than a philosopher or scientist. Haidt calls it "the rider", atop an "elephant" (our intuition), which is a servant to (not leader of) the elephant.

This means it doesn't make much sense at all to feel anger or revulsion toward a person when they express a view you find angering or repulsive. They are at the mercy of their subconscious and won't be able to give you a rational explanation no matter how hard you press them. It's clear to me now that doing so is the wrong way forward.

## Discussions should focus on mutual understanding

The implication of this is is that we should not approach questions of morality with the goal of discerning "the truth". Attempts to change someone's mind by seeking good arguments for or against a position are futile. They only put us on the defensive and set our minds to constructing justifications for positions we hold for reasons beyond our control to begin with. Ironically, this often has the effect of making us even more committed to those positions, armed now with even more explanations for holding them.

We should not think we can persuade someone to change their mind with logic and reason. This is one of my favourite quotes from the book:

> If you think that moral reasoning is something we do to figure out the truth, youâ€™ll be constantly frustrated by how foolish, biased, and illogical people become when they disagree with you.

This describes me. At first I was skeptical of Haidt's dismissal of reason as the engine of our ethical discernment, but after reading the book I'm pretty convinced that he's right. Instead of approaching conversations on topics of morality as debates, we should recognize that we all come, through no fault of our own, with a set of beliefs and conclusions that we probably don't understand very well, and engage in thoughtful conversation. This should make us much more charitable toward those we disagree with. Obviously ideal would be to have this posture of charity and grace toward others by default, but in my experience it doesn't come so naturally to most of us.

Maybe this is common knowledge to most people already, but judging from the general tone of discourse I witness, it seems it's likely not. If we really understood that the source of some views we consider repugnant is not in fact an evil soul or a cold, dead, heart, but a complex matrix of intuitions shaped by things we had no control over, we may be able to find just enough common ground to begin to engage in more civil conversations around some of those topics.
